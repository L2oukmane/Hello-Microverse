# Hello-Microverse

> This is a Hello World excercise, with no complex coding.

My goal here is to master all of the tools and best practices learned in previous microverse exercise like github flow and linters.

## Built With

- Lighthouse (An open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO and more).
- Webhint (A customizable linting tool that helps you improve your site's accessibility, speed, cross-browser compatibility, and more by checking your code for best practices and common errors).
- Stylelint (A mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your styles).

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

The basic requirements for building the executable are:

- VSCode or any other equivalent code editor
- node package manager
